# Edit the version of CMake

If you'd like to update CMake to the lastest version or some newer version, **do not do** `sudo apt-get autoremove cmake`, which will remove everything already compiled.

Instead, you'd better do as follows:

## 1. (Optional)Check where your CMake stuff is located

```bash
which cmake
```
and the returned path is the _parent path of your current cmake_.
Knowing where your CMake is, you can `sudo ln -sf <path to your desired cmake>/bin/* <parent path of your current cmake>`. This will overwrite the older version, but you can easily recover it by re-linking it to a older cmake.

 
## 2. Download the CMake package of the version desired

Go to https://cmake.org/files/ and find the cmake needed. Download it in '.tar.gz' format. Extract the compressed files to a local path.

## 3. Export a new path

```bash
echo $PATH
export PATH=<path to your newly extracted cmake>/bin:$PATH
```
Wait for a while and then check by typing `cmake --version`, yay the desired version will be returned!

## Something I tried (but weirdly didn't work at all)

As updating cmake using `sudo apt-get` is already supported on Ubuntu of any version, you can try it if you are not afraid of completely overwriting the older one. I referred to [the answer by _@Liu Hao Cheng_](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49859457/how-to-reinstall-the-latest-cmake-version).
If `Importerror no module named apt_pkg` is encountered, you can (possibly) solve it by
```bash
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
cp apt_pkg.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so apt_pkg.so
```
