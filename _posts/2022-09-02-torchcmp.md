# Torch, Torchvision and Torchaudio Compatibility

Kindly refer to [torchvision official README](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/README.rst) for the correspondence among python, torch and torchvision; [torchaudio officail README](https://github.com/pytorch/audio/blob/main/README.md) for the correspondence among python, torch and torchaudio.

You can install the desired version of software using commands formatted like
'''bash
pip install torchvision==<version>
pip install torchaudio==<version>
```
  
I am currently using `torch 1.11.0` so `torchvision 0.12.0` and `torchaudio 0.11.0` are compatible.
