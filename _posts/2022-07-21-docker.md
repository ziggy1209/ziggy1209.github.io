# All about docker.

## What is docker?

Copied and pasted from the official documents:

> Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

## Why docker?

> Developing apps today requires so much more than writing code. Multiple languages, frameworks, architectures, and discontinuous interfaces between tools for each lifecycle stage creates enormous complexity. Docker simplifies and accelerates your workflow, while giving developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project. Containers are a standardized unit of software that allows developers to isolate their app from its environment, solving the “it works on my machine” headache.

## How to use docker?

### 1. Install it

My docker is installed in the form of Docker Desktop on Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) and macOS Big Sur ver. 11.3.1. 

Docker Desktop includes:

- Docker Engine
- Docker CLI client
- Docker Compose-Docker Content Trust
- Kubernetes
- Credential Helper

So you DO NOT need to install Docker Engine before installing Docker Desktop.
TMI: `docker.io` is the name of an older version of Docker.

The standard procedure of installing Docker Desktop on Ubuntu is as shown in the official document https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/.
Note that if you are installing from some local area network and cannot fetch some images from the official website with error message like:
```bash
Err:5 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal Release
  Could not handshake: Error in the pull function. [IP: 13.227.74.108 443]
```
just try connecting to another network such as your own personal hotspot (...) and then it might work.

Also note that if you are working in the default home directory (direcetd by `cd`) while the DEB package in installed elsewhere, remember to move it to the working directory and then run `sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<version>-<arch>.deb`.

E.g., the version of Docker Desktop I installed is 4.10.1 and the architecture of my working computer is x86_64/amd64 (yeah they are the same thing - AMD created 64bit extension to Intel x86 instruction set. Intel adopted it and calls it x86–64. Other call it AMD64), so the command was `sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-4.10.1-amd64.deb`.
