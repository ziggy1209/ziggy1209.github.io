# Logging facilities for programming languages

Nearly all the programming languages have logging APIs provided by some standard library module. In _C++_, we have
`glog` and `gflags`, and in _Python_, we have the official `logging` module. A _logger_ logs the information you would
like to save for later reference and usually you can opt for printing them while executing the program.
This article is mainly about logging in _Python_.

There's a [lovely official guide about logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) where you can get to know how 
`logging` is used.

The format of the `msg` in a _logger_ is the same as that of formatted characters.
