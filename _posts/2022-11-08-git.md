# Git Commands Cheatsheet

## Basic pipeline 

**1. git clone \<repo path\>**
  
 where _\<repo path\>_ coulde be either SSH or HTTP - note that if you are cloning a repo to a remote server, use SSH.
 
 **2. cd \<local repo path\>**
 
 **3. git satus**
 
 Having made some changes to the scripts inside the repo, you can check all the local changes by this command.
 
 **4. git add \<file path\>**
 
 You can add new file to the repo using _git add_.
 
 **5. git commit -m \"description\"**
 
 If you are sure to submit the changes to the online repo main branch, use this command, where _description_ could be a breif summary of what you have done.
