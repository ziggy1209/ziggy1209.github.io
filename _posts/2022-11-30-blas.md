# BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)

## Introduction (TBD)

## CBLAS by OpenBLAS

### Installation

### Usage:

The most basic function used in _cblas_ would probably be `cblas_dgemm`, and the variables used in the function can be referred in the official header file `cbals.h`:
```cpp
void cblas_dgemm(CBLAS_LAYOUT layout, CBLAS_TRANSPOSE TransA,
                  CBLAS_TRANSPOSE TransB, const int M, const int N,
                  const int K, const double alpha, const double *A,
                  const int lda, const double *B, const int ldb,
                  const double beta, double *C, const int ldc);
```
where `d` means **d**ouble precision, `ge` means **ge**neric matrices, `mm` means **m**atrix **m**ultiplication. 

What these variables actually denote are as follows:

`CBLAS_LAYOUT layout`: How the matrices are formatted, `CblasColMajor` or `CblasRowMajor`.

`CBLAS_TRANSPOSE TransA`: Whether the layout of matrix A is the same as `layout` - if `CblasNoTrans`, same; if `CblasTrans`, different. E.g., if `layout` is col-major and `TransA` is `CblasTrans`, the layout of matrix A is row-major.

`CBLAS_TRANSPOSE TransB`: the same usage as `TransA`'s.

`lda` & `ldb` & `ldc`: The strides represent the distances in memory between elements in adjacent rows (if row-major) or in adjacent columns (if column-major). Usually equal to the number of rows/columns if the matrices are not part of some bigger matrices.

We can get to know how the function is used better in the [official code example](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/wiki/User-Manual).
