# Acoustic Features: PLP (and a bit of MFCC)

The first several steps of computing the PLP overlap with those of MFCCs: pre-emphasis (optional?), windowing (usually Hamming), STFT, power spectrum, then a filter bank - Bark for PLP and Mel for MFCC. 

I tried writing something nice but in the meantime I found one that's almost perfectly written - so I will jusr refer to it when needed instead of writing my own piece.

The link to this masterpiece(?) is: [Performance Evaluation of Front-end Processing for Speech Recognition
Systems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252254498_Performance_Evaluation_of_Front-end_Processing_for_Speech_Recognition_Systems?enrichId=rgreq-b977083292394bb811ae4ca2fbd6078f-XXX&enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzI1MjI1NDQ5ODtBUzoxMDMzOTYyMDM4MjcyMDZAMTQwMTY2Mjk4NDMyMg%3D%3D&el=1_x_2&_esc=publicationCoverPdf). 

Kudos to Octavian, Waleed, and Zoran.

Furthermore, to quote some of the findings I found worth noting in the paper above: in speaker-dependent recognition experiments (ten digits uttered by the same speaker five times), MFCC performs slightly better than PLP in general, except for the static feature at 5dB SNR, where MFCC is 2% worse than PLP; in speaker-independent experiments (using TIMIT dataset consisting of 6300 utterances, with 10 sentences spoken by each of the 630 speakers), PLP and MFCC has similar recognition rates, although PLP performs marginally better than MFCC in noisy conditions (0-10dB SNR, with a difference about 1 to 2%.
