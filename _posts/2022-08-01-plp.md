# Acoustic Features: PLP (\& a bit of MFCC)

The first several steps of computing the PLP overlaps with those of MFCCs: pre-emphasis (optional?), windowing (usually Hamming), STFT, power spectrum, then a filter bank - Bark for PLP and Mel for MFCC. 

I tried writing something nice but in the meantime I found one that's almost perfectly written - so I will jusr refer to it when needed instead of writing my own piece.

The link to this masterpiece(?) is: [Performance Evaluation of Front-end Processing for Speech Recognition

Kudos to Octavian, Waleed, and Zoran.
